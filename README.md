Edit: No longer using UML Class Diagram Editor due to obscure issue where class was preventing gvi compilation (with no way to fix the error; my best guess is the .ucd file was out of date in some way behind the scenes.)
Here's a cool and upcoming add-on by VI Technologies for LabVIEW NXG: [UML Class Diagram Editor](http://uml-addon.com/). What little I've gotten to use it, it's pretty cool especially if you're familiar with UML and want to interact with a program from that angle.
